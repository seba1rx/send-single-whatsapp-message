# send-single-whatsapp-message
Simple vanilla javascript code to send a single whatsapp message to a whatsapp destination


I took a piece of code from 

https://github.com/rafaelbotazini/floating-whatsapp 

and a function from 

https://stackoverflow.com/questions/11381673/detecting-a-mobile-browser

to put together a simple way to send a whatsapp message.

Just include the script and invoke the function sendCustomWhatsappMessage(theDestination,theMsg); to send a message.
